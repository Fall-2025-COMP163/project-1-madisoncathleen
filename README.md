# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# 🎭 Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# 📁 Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py -v

# Test your main program
python project1_starter.py

# ---------------------------------------------------------- CREATORS NOTES ----------------------------------------------------------------

# For the most part, when I was thinking about what kind of concept I wanted this to have I wanted to go with a staple, and what's more staple-y than Dungeons and Dragons? So I think from here on out it'll be based off of a campaign I played in.

As for my stat formulas, I didn't want it to be too basic or too complex, but I think it'll keep everything easy to read and debug, but also not as generic.

I plan on adding unique features in the second project, simply because I'm not sure which direction we'll go, and what creative feature I'd actually use.

Running the code should be easy, it'll allow the user to input their own choices to check for complete compatibility. {Yippee!}

AI helped a bit throughout the code, such as debugging and helping me understand some concepts I needed to brush up on.
